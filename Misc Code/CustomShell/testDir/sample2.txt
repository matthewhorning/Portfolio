EXT. SPACE 
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. 
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main 
Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity. 
War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the 
ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on 
both sides. Evil is everywhere.
In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General 
Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and 
kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic 
Senate. 
As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the 
besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi 
Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive 
Chancellor....
PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue 
to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter 
and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. 
TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, 
dodging flack and enemy laser fire. 
R2-D2 is on ANAKIN'S ship. R4-P17 is on OBI-WAN'S ship. 
A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships 
continue their assault in a synchronous ballet. 
INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT - SPACE 
OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship 
rocks violently. 
INT. ANAKINâ€™S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT - SPACE 
ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP 
FIGHTER. ANAKIN 
There isn't a droid made that can out fly 
you, Master, and no other way to get to 
the Chancellor... 
OBI-WAN 
Look out, four droids inbound... 
EXT. CORUSCANT - SPACE BATTLE 
The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE 
FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. 
After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the 
FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in 
a ball of flame. 
INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT - SPACE 
Obi-Wan struggles to maintain control of his ship. 
OBI-WAN 
We've got to split them up. 
ANAKIN 
Break left, fly through the guns on that 
tower. 
Obi-Wan flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC 
CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow. 
OBI-WAN 
Easy for you to say. Why am I always the 
bait? 
ANAKIN 
Don't worry. I'm coming around behind 
you. 
Obi-Wan deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's
superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his 
tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI
Anakin, they're all over me! 
ANAKIN 
Dead ahead! Closing... lock onto him, 
Artoo. 
Artoo BEEPS his reply as Anakin swoops in for the kill. 
He BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES. 
2.ANAKIN
(laughs)
We got him, Artoo! 
Anakin BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as 
Artoo BEEPS an angry warning. 
ANAKIN
I copy, Artoo. 
OBI-WAN 
I'm going down on the deck. 
ANAKIN 
Good idea... I need some room to 
maneuver, though. 
Obi-Wan dives toward the surface of one of the larger 
TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through 
a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, 
followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by 
Anakin. 
ANAKIN
Cut right. Do you hear me? Cut right. 
Don't let him get a handle on you. Come 
on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on! 
Artoo BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP 
FIGHTER. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI
Hurry up! I don't like this! 
Obi-Wan flies through a narrow gap between two towers on 
a Battleship. 
The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a 
laser blast, parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's 
Astro Droid, R-4. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI
Ouch! 
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI
Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've 
shut it down. 
ANAKIN 
We're locked on... we've got him. 
3.Anakin drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows 
him apart. Artoo SQUEALS with delight. 
ANAKIN
Yeah! We got him... good going, Artoo. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI
Next time you're the bait... Now let's 
find the Command Ship and get on with it. 
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak. 
ANAKIN
Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General 
Grievous's ship is directly ahead. 
Artoo BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's 
cockpit. 
ANAKIN
The one crawling with vulture droids. 
INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT
OBI-WAN KENOBI 
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy. 
Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with bat-like DROID 
VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. 
The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, 
lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS. 
ANAKIN 
Come on, Master. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI
Not this time. There's too much at 
stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you 
copy? 
ODD BALL (OS) 
Copy, Red Leader. 
OBI-WAN KENOBI 
Mark my position and form your squad up 
behind me... 
4.INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT
ODD BALL 
We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set 
S-foils in attack position. 
The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of 
the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRIFIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS 
heading toward the Jedi. 
The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the 
ends of their wings. 
INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT
ANAKIN 
This is where the fun begins.
