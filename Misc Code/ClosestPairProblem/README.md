# Closest Pair Problem

The goal of this assignment was to implement a more efficient Closest Pair algorithm. The brute force solution was already implemented, and the efficient solution was required as the assignment. This was implemented using a recursive algorithm which split the list in half, got the closest pair of each half, then compared against all points less than delta from the median point in order to determine the closest pair.
