# About

The goal for this group assignment was to create a Java Swing based application using object oriented principles, specifically looking to implement the model-view-controller design paradigm. As part of this assignment, we also created UML diagrams for our application during the planning phases.

We chose to create a game based on Texas Hold'em, styled after the popular 2001 movie Shrek. The game supports all basic actions in Poker as well as multiple difficulty levels and save games.

### Project Date: *Spring 2019*

## My Contributions

I worked primarily on the controller, view, and wrote a couple tests.
