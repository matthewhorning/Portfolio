# About

A competetive multiplayer game created using the Roblox platform, written entirely in Lua. Written with object oriented principles in mind, the project is fully playable and content complete. The project was completed alongside another person who was responsible for asset creation. The user interface is implemented using an open source UI library I wrote whose source code is provided here, along with other code snippets from the project.

### Project Date: *Summer 2020*

## My Responsibilities
All code for the project was written by me unless indicated by comments. Asset creation was split 50/50, and interface/front-end was designed and implemented by me.
